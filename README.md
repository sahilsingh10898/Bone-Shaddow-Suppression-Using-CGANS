X-Ray Image Denoising Project

Overview :-
This project focuses on denoising X-ray images using a deep learning model. The model is designed to improve the quality of noisy X-ray images, making them clearer for medical analysis and diagnostics.

Model Architecture:-
The model architecture is based on an encoder-decoder structure, commonly used for image denoising tasks. The specific architecture details are as follows:

Encoder Layers: The encoder compresses the input image into a lower-dimensional representation. The layers in the encoder have the following filter sizes: [64, 124, 256, 512, 1024].

Decoder Layers: The decoder reconstructs the image from the compressed representation, gradually increasing the resolution. The layers in the decoder have the following filter sizes: [1024, 512, 256, 124, 64].

This architecture allows the model to effectively learn the noise patterns and remove them from the X-ray images.

Performance Metrics
The performance of the model was evaluated using two primary metrics: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).

Training Performance:

Peak PSNR: 26
SSIM Index: 0.8
Validation Performance:

PSNR: 25
SSIM Index: 0.75
These metrics indicate that the model performs well in enhancing the quality of the X-ray images, both in training and validation datasets.

Usage
To use this model for denoising your X-ray images:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see requirements.txt).
Run the denoising script with your X-ray images as input.
Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:

TensorFlow
NumPy
OpenCV (for image processing)
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the project.

Results
The denoised images show a significant reduction in noise, with improved clarity and contrast, as evidenced by the PSNR and SSIM metrics. The model is suitable for use in medical imaging tasks where noise reduction is critical.

Future Work
Fine-Tuning: Further fine-tuning of the model may improve performance, particularly on different datasets.
Generalization: Testing the model on a wider range of X-ray datasets to evaluate its generalization capability.
Integration: Integrating the denoising model into a complete pipeline for medical image analysis.
